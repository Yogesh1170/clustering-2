    "Hierarchical clustering is an unsupervised clustering technique that involves creating clusters in a predefined order. The clusters are ordered in a top-to-bottom manner, and similar clusters are grouped together and arranged in a hierarchical manner. Hierarchical clustering can be further divided into two types: agglomerative hierarchical clustering and divisive hierarchical clustering ¹.\n",

    "In contrast, non-hierarchical clustering involves the formation of new clusters by merging or splitting the clusters. It does not follow a tree-like structure like hierarchical clustering. This technique groups the data to maximize or minimize some evaluation criteria. K-means clustering is an effective way of non-hierarchical clustering ¹.\n",

Non-hierarchical clustering is comparatively more reliable than hierarchical clustering, but the clusters are difficult to read and understand as compared to hierarchical clustering.\n",

Non-hierarchical clustering is comparatively faster than hierarchical clustering, but it can work better than hierarchical clustering even when there is an error in the data ¹."
